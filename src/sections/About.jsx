â€» I enjoy turning complex problems into clean solutions, whether it's through DSA in C++, building full-stack apps with the MERN stack, or exploring AI/ML models.
â€» My journey so far has been about balance â€” combining the logic-driven world of coding with the discipline of fitness, structured learning, and continuous growth. From grinding LeetCode contests to creating portfolio-ready React projects, I approach everything with a mindset of clarity, consistency, and improvement.

â€» I'm currently sharpening my skills in DSA, Web-Development, AI-ML while building projects that reflect creativity and solid engineering.

â€» When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me in the gym pushing for the next milestone or diving into action-packed anime for a rush of inspiration.`;
